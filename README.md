# Booking App in Go

This app is a CLI booking app. It is written in Go and is very simple as it is purely to learn the basics of the language:

- Functions
- Packages
- Modules
- Structs
- Data types
- Go Routines

If you wish to run the app, make sure to have Go installed, and run it with `go run .`
